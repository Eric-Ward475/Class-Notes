**The Nature of Matter (Section 1)
- The basic unit of matter is the **Atom**
	- The center of all Atoms is called the **Nucleus**
	- The nucleus is made of **protons** (Positive charge) and **neutrons** (No charge)
	- Outside of the nucleus are electrons (Negative charge)
- Isotopes are atoms that have different numbers of neutrons
	- Normal atoms have the same number of protons and neutrons
	- An isotope becomes radioactive when it has an unstable nucleus
- A compound is a thing that is composed of two or more separate elements

**Chemical Bonds (Section 1)**
- There are multiple types of bonds
	- When electrons are transferred, **ionic** bonds are formed
	- When electrons are shared, **covalent** bonds are formed
- Negatively or positively charged atoms are called **ions**
- When multiple atoms are bound together, it is called a molecule
