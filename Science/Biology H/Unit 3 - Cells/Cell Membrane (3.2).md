### Structure
###### Phospholipid bilayer
- The cell membrane is primarily composed of a double layer of phospholipids
- Integral proteins are embedded in the bilayer, allowing for transport of larger, charged or polar molecules
- The bilayer is selectively permeable, allowing only small, non polar molecules to pass through easily

### Function
###### Phospholipid bilayer
- Acts as a barrier between the cell and the outside
- Keeps the shape of the cell
- Controls what enters and exits the cell

###### Integral proteins
- Allow the transport of molecules that the bilayer does not ordinarily allow through
