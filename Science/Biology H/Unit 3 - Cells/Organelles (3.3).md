### Eukaryotic
- Eukaryotic cells have many more organelles than prokaryotic ones
- They include:
	- Nucleus: Houses DNA
	- Mitochondria: Carries out cellular respiration, makes ATP
	- Endoplasmic Reticulum: Network of membrane, responsible for protein and lipid synthesis
	- Golgi Apparatus: Packages proteins and other materials
	- Lysosome: Breaks down waste, harmful substances and old cell parts
	- Vacuole: Large membrane bound storage areas; plants have one very large central one, used to store water for photosynthesis
	- Chloroplast: Plant specific; where plants carry out photosynthesis
	- Cell Wall: Non Animal; Rigid layer outside the cell membrane, maintains the cell's shape
	- Ribosome: Not membrane bound; not eukaryotic specific; Where proteins are synthesized
	- Cytoplasm: The jelly like substance that fills empty space within the cell
- Each has a specific function crucial to cell function

### Prokaryotic
- Prokaryotic cells are much simpler than Eukaryotic ones
- They contain no membrane bound organelles
- Their organelles:
	- Ribosome: Not prokaryotic specific; Where proteins are synthesized
	- Nucleoid region: The region where DNA is stored, NOT A NUCLEUS
	- Cell Wall: Protects the cell, holds the shape of the cell
