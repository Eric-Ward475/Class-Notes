### Introduction

**The Nature of Matter**
- The basic unit of matter is the Atom
	- The center of all Atoms is called the Nucleus
	- The nucleus is made of protons (Positive charge) and neutrons (No charge)
	- Outside of the nucleus are electrons (Negative charge)
- Isotopes are atoms that have different numbers of neutrons
	- Normal atoms have the same number of protons and neutrons
	- An isotope becomes radioactive when it has an unstable nucleus
- A compound is a thing that is composed of two or more separate elements

**Chemical Bonds**
- There are multiple types of bonds
	- When electrons are transferred, ionic bonds are formed, keeping atoms together because of the difference in charge
	- When electrons are shared, covalent bonds are formed
		- Covalent bonds can be polar or non-polar
		- Polar bonds have a separation in charge
		- Non-polar bonds have no separation in charge
- Negatively or positively charged atoms are called ions
- When multiple atoms are bound together, it is called a molecule

**Hydrogen Bonds**
- Bonds that form when negatively charged oxygen bonds to positively charged hydrogen
- Common when H<sub>2</sub>0 (water) is present
- This is what gives water its relatively high surface tension
- Adhesion is when a liquid hydrogen bonds to other surfaces or liquids
- Cohesion is when a liquid hydrogen bonds to itself
- Hydrogen bonds can only form when polar covalent bonds are present
- A molecule that is polar, is hydrophilic, meaning that it can mix with water
	- Different parts of molecules can be polar or non-polar
- A non-polar molecule is hydrophobic, meaning that it does not dissolve in water, and stays separate
	- Eg: Vegetable oil in water

**Monomers and Polymers**
- Monomers are simple molecules
- Polymers are a collection of monomers bonded together

**Biological Reactions**
- Catabolism breaks molecules into smaller units and energy (Hydrolysis)
- Anabolism takes the smaller units and energy and forms molecules (Dehydration Synthesis)
- Exothermic reactions release heat into the surrounding environment
- Dehydration synthesis is anabolic and endothermic
- Hydrolysis is catabolic and endothermic
- Activation energy is the initial amount of energy required to start a chemical reaction
