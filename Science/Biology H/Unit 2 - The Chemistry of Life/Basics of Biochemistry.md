### Introduction

**The Nature of Matter**
- The basic unit of matter is the Atom
	- The center of all Atoms is called the Nucleus
	- The nucleus is made of protons (Positive charge) and neutrons (No charge)
	- Outside of the nucleus are electrons (Negative charge)
- Isotopes are atoms that have different numbers of neutrons
	- Normal atoms have the same number of protons and neutrons
	- An isotope becomes radioactive when it has an unstable nucleus
- A compound is a thing that is composed of two or more separate elements

**Chemical Bonds**
- There are multiple types of bonds
	- When electrons are transferred, ionic bonds are formed, keeping atoms together because of the difference in charge
	- When electrons are shared, covalent bonds are formed
		- Covalent bonds can be polar or non-polar
		- Polar bonds have a separation in charge
		- Non-polar bonds have no separation in charge
- Negatively or positively charged atoms are called ions
- When multiple atoms are bound together, it is called a molecule

**Hydrogen Bonds**
- Bonds that form when negatively charged oxygen bonds to positively charged hydrogen
- Common when H<sub>2</sub>0 (water) is present
- This is what gives water its relatively high surface tension
- Adhesion is when a liquid hydrogen bonds to other surfaces or liquids
- Cohesion is when a liquid hydrogen bonds to itself
- Hydrogen bonds can only form when polar covalent bonds are present
- A molecule that is polar, is hydrophilic, meaning that it can mix with water
	- Different parts of molecules can be polar or non-polar
- A non-polar molecule is hydrophobic, meaning that it does not dissolve in water, and stays separate
	- Eg: Vegetable oil in water

**Monomers and Polymers**
- Monomers are simple molecules
- Polymers are a collection of monomers bonded together

### Biological Macro-molecules

- All biological macro-molecules are made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur
	- Acronym: CHONPS
	- Not all molecules use all of them (Eg: Carbohydrates only use carbon, hydrogen and oxygen)

**Carbohydrates**
- Simple molecules used for
	- Easy/quick access to energy
	- Structure building
- Built from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, in a 1:2:1 ratio 
- Most organisms use a sugar, glucose, for energy
	- Glucose is a small carb and a simple sugar
- Humans chain glucose monomers together in a large polymer called glycogen, which is stored in the liver and muscles, to be used later for energy
- Carbs are used for energy because they are easy to break down into ATP, the standard energy molecule
- A molecule can be used for energy, only if the energy released from breaking its bonds is greater than the amount of energy required to break those bonds
- Carbs are mostly hydrophilic, meaning that they can usually be dissolved in water

**Lipids**
- Lipids a broad category of macromolecule
	- Some are used as bulk energy storage
	- Some make up cell membranes
	- Some make up hormones/steroids
	- All are insoluble in water (can not dissolve, hydrophobic)
- Lipids are made of carbon, hydrogen and sometimes oxygen
- They are often found in the form of fats, oils, waxes and steroids
- The most common type of lipid are triglycerides, used for large amounts of energy storage
	- Triglycerides are formed by a glycerol 'backbone' and 3 fatty acid 'tails'
