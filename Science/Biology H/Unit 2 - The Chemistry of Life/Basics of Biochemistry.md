### Introduction

**The Nature of Matter**
- The basic unit of matter is the Atom
	- The center of all Atoms is called the Nucleus
	- The nucleus is made of protons (Positive charge) and neutrons (No charge)
	- Outside of the nucleus are electrons (Negative charge)
- Isotopes are atoms that have different numbers of neutrons
	- Normal atoms have the same number of protons and neutrons
	- An isotope becomes radioactive when it has an unstable nucleus
- A compound is a thing that is composed of two or more separate elements

**Chemical Bonds**
- There are multiple types of bonds
	- When electrons are transferred, ionic bonds are formed, keeping atoms together because of the difference in charge
	- When electrons are shared, covalent bonds are formed
		- Covalent bonds can be polar or non-polar
		- Polar bonds have a separation in charge
		- Non-polar bonds have no separation in charge
- Negatively or positively charged atoms are called ions
- When multiple atoms are bound together, it is called a molecule

**Hydrogen Bonds**
- Bonds that form when negatively charged oxygen bonds to positively charged hydrogen
- Common when H<sub>2</sub>0 (water) is present
- This is what gives water its relatively high surface tension
- Adhesion is when a liquid hydrogen bonds to other surfaces or liquids
- Cohesion is when a liquid hydrogen bonds to itself
- Hydrogen bonds can only form when polar covalent bonds are present
- A molecule that is polar, is hydrophilic, meaning that it can mix with water
	- Different parts of molecules can be polar or non-polar
- A non-polar molecule is hydrophobic, meaning that it does not dissolve in water, and stays separate
	- Eg: Vegetable oil in water

**Monomers and Polymers**
- Monomers are simple molecules
- Polymers are a collection of monomers bonded together

### Biological Macro-molecules

- All biological macro-molecules are made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur
	- Acronym: CHONPS
	- Not all molecules use all of them (Eg: Carbohydrates only use carbon, hydrogen and oxygen)

**Carbohydrates**
- Simple molecules used for
	- Easy/quick access to energy
	- Structure building
- Built from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, in a 1:2:1 ratio 
- Most organisms use a sugar, glucose, for energy
	- Glucose is a small carb and a simple sugar
- Humans chain glucose monomers together in a large polymer called glycogen, which is stored in the liver and muscles, to be used later for energy
- Carbs are used for energy because they are easy to break down into ATP, the standard energy molecule
- A molecule can be used for energy, only if the energy released from breaking its bonds is greater than the amount of energy required to break those bonds
- Carbs are mostly hydrophilic, meaning that they can usually be dissolved in water

**Lipids**
- Lipids a broad category of macro-molecule
	- Some are used as bulk energy storage
	- Some make up cell membranes
	- Some make up hormones/steroids
	- All are insoluble in water (can not dissolve, hydrophobic)
- Lipids are made of carbon, hydrogen and sometimes oxygen and phosphorus
- They are often found in the form of fats, oils, waxes and steroids
- The most common type of lipid are triglycerides, used for large amounts of energy storage
	- Triglycerides are formed by a glycerol 'backbone' and 3 fatty acid 'tails'
	- The 'tails' contain many carbons bonded to hydrogen
	- These carbon-hydrogen bonds contain a lot if energy
	- Triglycerides can have saturated or unsaturated fatty acids
		- Saturated acids have the maximum amount of hydrogen bonded to the carbons in the tail
		- Saturated acids can cause blood clots, leading to cardiovascular problems
		- Saturated fats are usually solid
		- Unsaturated acids do not have the maximum, and contain double bonded carbon instead
		- Unsaturated acids do not have this problem
		- Unsaturated fats are usually liquid, such as oil
		- Trans fats are originally unsaturated fats, with extra hydrogen atoms added in
			- Used in baking
- Phospholipids are used in the construction of the cell membrane
	- They are polar in regions and not, in others
	- This allows some molecules to pass through easily, while others can not
- Hormones and steroids are messengers that travel through the blood and into cells
	- They are all built from cholesterol

**Proteins**
- Have very diverse functions
	- Some are called enzymes, or proteins that speed up chemical reactions in cells
	- Some are used as antibodies, aiding in immune defnese
	- Some are used for structure, such as collagen and keratin
	- There are some protein hormones, like insulin and hemoglobin
- Structure of proteins:
	- Has 3-4 layers of structure
		- Primary
		- Secondary
		- Tertiary
		- Some have Quaternary
	- Built from a chain of amino acids
		- There are 20 amino acids
		- Some chains are shorter, while others can be extremely long
	- Primary structure is the initial chain of amino acids
	- Secondary structure is when amino acids bond together to form structures called alpha helices (singular: alpha helix) and beta sheets
		- Formed when amino acids hydrogen bond together
	- Tertiary structure is when the protein folds itself
		- Formed when the protein's variable r-structures bond and interact with each other
	- Quaternary structure forms when multiple amino acid chains fold together
		- Not all proteins have this
		- Hemoglobin is an example

**Nucleic Acids**
- Nucleic acids are responsible for storing genetic data and carrying instructions for manufacturing proteins within cells
- The monomers are nucleotides, with 3 parts
	- A sugar
	- Phosphate group
	- Nitrogen base
- There are 3 nucleic acid:
	- DNA
		- Contains all genes
		- 4 nitrogen bases, A, T, C, G
			- A binds with T, C binds with G
	- RNA
		- Contains instructions for ribosomes to make proteins
		- 4 nitrogen bases, A, U, C, G
			- A binds with U, C binds with G
	- ATP
		- Used for energy - not like other nucleic acids
