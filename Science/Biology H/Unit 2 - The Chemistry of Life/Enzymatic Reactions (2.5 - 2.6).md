**Intro**
- Substrates are the molecules that enzymes bind to
- Activation energy is the amount of energy required to start a chemical reaction
- Catalyze means to speed up a reaction

**Enzymes**
- Enzymes are a type of protein used to speed up chemical reactions within cells
- They are the broadest category of proteins
- Enzymes bind to substrates on a surface called the 'active site'
- They work by lowering the activation energy of a reaction
- Each enzyme has a certain optimal condition set, with conditions such as
	- pH level (a measure of how acidic or basic a substance is, a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions)
	- Temperature
- If the conditions stray too far from an enzyme's optimal, they will denature, rendering them useless
	- If they can not perfectly fit the shape of the substrate they are meant to catalyze, they are useless
	- Enzymes shapes are very specific, and only work on specific substrates
- After an enzyme is used to catalyze a reaction, it is reused for another of the same reaction
