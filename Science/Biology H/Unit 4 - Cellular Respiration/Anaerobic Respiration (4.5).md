###### Purpose
- To allow cells to make ATP in times of little oxygen by refreshing the NAD+ amounts within cells (allows glycolysis to happen repeatedly)

### Lactic Acid Fermentation
###### Equation
2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH ---> 2 NAD$^{+}$ + 2 Lactic Acid

- Takes place in the cytoplasm
- Anaerobic
- Yeast, bacteria, and muscle cells

### Alcohol Fermentation
###### Equation
2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH ---> 2 NAD$^{+}$ + 2 CO2 + 2 Ethanol

- Takes place in the cytoplasm
- Anaerobic
- Yeast and bacteria use it
