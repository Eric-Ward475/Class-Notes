### Steps
1. Uses the flow of electrons to move H+ from a low to a high concentration
2. Creates a Hydrogen Ion gradient (acts as stored energy)
3. When hydrogen ions move back down the gradient, this releases the energy required for ATP production through the enzyme, ATP Synthase

### Purpose
- Make 34-38 ATP aerobically

### Inputs/Reactants
- NADH
	- Produced in the Krebs Cycle
- FADH2
	- Produced in the Krebs Cycle
- $O_{2}$

### Outputs/Products
- 32-38 ATP
- $H_{2}O$
	- $O_{2}$ is the final electron ($e^{-}$) acceptor, the electrons that are used by $NADH$ and $FADH_{2}$ to move $H^{+}$ against their concentration gradient
	- $O_{2}$ bonds with $H^{+}$ to form $H_{2}O$
	- Chem equation: $0_{2} + e^{-} + 2H^{+} \rightarrow H_{2}O$

### General info
- Takes place in the inner membrane of the mitochondria
- Aerobic process
- Eukaryotic organisms use it
