**Measuring Segments**
- We can measure segments by using tools such as rulers, tape measures, odometers and smart devices
- Common units of measure include inches, feet and kilometers
- Only line SEGMENTS can be measures

**Measuring Angles**
- Angles are measured through the use of a Protracto
- Units of measure for angles are degrees and radians

**Classifying Angles**
- Angles are divided into 4 categories:
	- Acute (<90 degrees, >0 degrees)
	- Right (90 degrees)
	- Obtuse (>90 degrees, <180 degrees)
	- Straight (180 degrees)
- The largest angles in geometry are straight angles

**Parts of a Degree**
- We can write degrees as decimals, fractions and minutes + seconds
	- 60 minutes in a degree
	- 60 seconds in a minute
	- Degrees denoted with a single apostrophe (')
	- Minutes denoted with a double apostrophe ('')
- Example:
	- 24.5 degrees = 24 degrees 30' 0''

**Congruency**
- Things that are congruent are the same
- Congruent angles have the same measure
- Congruent segments have the same length
- Denoted with matching tick marks

**Clock Problems**
- Used to find the angle between the hands of a clock
- Every hour between each hand is 30 degrees
	- 360 degrees divided by 12 hours = 30 degrees each
