**The Structure of Geometry**
- Geometry is based on **deductive structure**

**Deductive Structure**
- A system of thought in which conclusions are justified by means of previously assumed or proved statements
- Theorems are previously proven mathematical statements
- Undefined terms are things that cant be accurately defined (eg points)
- Definitions state the meaning of an idea or term
- Postulates are unproved assumptions

**Conditional Statements**
- Any statement in if-then format
- Symbol/Shorthand is --> (An arrow)
	- X --> Y is the same as *If X, then Y*

**Manipulation of Conditionals**
- We manipulate conditionals to help prove other things
	- **Negation** is when you change everything to false
		- If we negate 'If X, then Y', the result would be 'If not X, then not Y'
		- The symbol for 'not' in math is '~' (tilda)
	- **Converse** is the reversal of the order of terms in a conditional
		- Converses are not always true
		- The converse of a definition is always true
	- **Inverse** is the **negation** of a statement
	- **Contrapositives** Are when a statement is reversed and negated
		- Maintains the truth value of the original statement
