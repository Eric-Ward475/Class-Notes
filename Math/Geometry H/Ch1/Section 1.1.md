**Points**
- Represented by dots
- Named with capital letters

**Lines**
- Extend infinitely in both directions
- Made up of an infinite amount of points
- Named with the angle symbol and the names of 2 points along them
	- Order does not matter

**Rays**
- Lines but with one bounding point
- Extend infinitely only in one direction
- Named with two points
	- The order does matter; the first point listed needs to be the single bounding point

**Line Segments**
- Lines, but with a finite length
- Have two bounding points

**Angles**
- Angles are two rays with a common endpoint
- The common endpoint is called the vertex
- The rays themselves are called the sides of the angle
- Named with 3 points, with the second being the vertex's name

**Triangles**
- Made up of 3 segments and 3 angles
- Order does not matter
- A triangle is the Union of 3 segments

**Union**
- The union of two data sets is all the assets of each combined
- The symbol for unions is a capital U
- Example:
	- {1,2,3,a,b,c} U {4,5,6,d,e,f} = {1,2,3,4,5,6,a,b,c,d,e,f}

**Intersections**
- The intersection of two data sets is a set of the elements that appear in both sets
- The symbol for Intersections is an upside-down union symbol
- Example:
	- {1, 2, 3} in intersection with {A, B, 1} = {1}
