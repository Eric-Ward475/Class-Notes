**Collinearity**
- Points that are on the same line are collinear
- Points not on the same line are non-collinear
- Any 2 points are collinear

**Betweenness**
- When there are 3 points on a line, that are collinear, tho one between the 2 others has betweenness.

**Triangle Inequality**
- In order to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of the shorter sides (legs) is always greater than the length of the longest side (hypotenuse)

**Assumptions**
- You can assume straight lines and relative position
- You can not assume anything else, this includes:
	- Angle measures
	- Segment measures
	- Congruency
	- Sizes
