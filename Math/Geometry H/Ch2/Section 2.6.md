**Multiplication Property**
- Used for bisection and trisection
- If sub segments of different angles (or segments) are congruent, the whole angle (or segment) is also congruent
- If segments or angles are congruent, their like multiples are too

**Division Property**
- Used for bisection and trisection
- If segments (or angles) are congruent, their like divisions are also congruent

**NOTE:**
- Look for double use of the word trisection, bisection or midpoints in the given information
- The multiplication property is used when the segments or angles in the conclusion are greater than those in the given information
- The division property is used when the segments or angles in the conclusion are less that those in the given information
