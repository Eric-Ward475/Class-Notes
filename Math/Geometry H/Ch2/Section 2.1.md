**Perpendicularity**
- Lines, rays or segments that intersect at a right angle are perpendicular
- The symbol for perpendicularity is an upside down 'T'

**Coordinate Plane**
- The coordinate plane is formed when two perpendicular lines meet
- Also called the Cartesian Plane
- The horizontal line is called the X-Axis
- The vertical line is called the Y-Axis
- Each point is represented by an ordered pair, in the form (x, y)
- The values of x and y are called the point's coordinates
- The intersection of the axes is called the origin
