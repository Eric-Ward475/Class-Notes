**Substitution Property**
- Used when things are completely equal
- If x = 3, then in all cases, we can substitute x for 3, or 3 for x in any situation
- Useful when solving systems of equations and proving equality

**Transitive Property**
- If angles (or segments) are congruent to the same angles (or segments), then they are congruent to each other
- Expands on Substitution by chaining more than 2 equalities together (If W = X, X = Y, and Y = Z, then W = Z)
