For Review Questions (Pg 165) 

1. What is meant by the ascension of Jesus? When do Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Ascension? 
    
The Ascension is the returning to heaven of the Risen Christ forty days after his Resurrection. The Feast of the Ascension is celebrated 40 days after Easter Sunday. 

2. What happened at Pentecost? When do Christians celebrate the Feast of Pentecost? 
    
At Pentecost, the power of the Holy Spirit was poured out to the Apostles, according to Jesus’ word. Acts describes it as a marvelous, grand event. The apostles told that the coming was like a strong diving wind, filling the house that they were in, and then there were tongues of fire, which came to each of them, filling them with the holy spirit. Christians celebrate Pentecost every year on Pentecost Sunday, 50 days after Easter. 

3. Describe the meaning of the three images of the Spirit’s power at Pentecost. 
    
The strong wind, that swept away any doubts or hesitations in the apostles represents the power and strength of God and his ability to fortify and strengthen anyone. The tongues of fire that touches each of the apostles shows that God touches each of us every day, and the Holy spirit is with us all the time. Maybe fire won’t physically touch us, but the passage serves as a reminder to all that God cares for each of us on a personal level and only wants the best for us. The Apostles gaining the ability to speak in tongues shows our mission as Catholics; to spread the good news to anyone we can. 

4. What was Paul’s important role in the early church? 
    
Paul was most responsible for spreading the Gospel beyond Jerusalem. Paul was a convert from a Jewish Pharisee who persecuted Christians. Paul wrote many letters during his life, directed at various communities, he even wrote while in prison. He was very passionate about his work, and spread the Good News to countless people. Eventually, he was arrested for inciting rebellion, taken to Rome and placed under house arrest, where he remained for several years. Peter, another great early Apostle, came to Rome to lead the Church, but later was martyred. Paul was also killed for his faith, in around AD 64-67. 

5. When and why did the Christian movement separate from Judaism? 
    
Early Christians followed the Jewish Law strictly, but also broke bread in their homes, in remembrance of Christ. After the Jewish Temple was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70, The Jewish leaders became concerned of the differences between the Christians and the Jews. They began to no longer consider the Christians to be Jews, and then the 2 religions split.
