Page 172 For Review Questions 

1. Give a definition of the church, including its mission. 
    
The Church is the gathering of those who profess belief in Jesus Christ and are baptized into that faith, beyond that, the Church is the active presence of Christ in the world; we are his hands and feet, continuing his work on Earth. Our mission is to proclaim and bring about the Kingdom of God, continuing what Jesus started. 

2. In what sense is Mary the mother of the Church? 
    
Mary is considered the mother of the Church because of her willingness to accept God’s plan. She gave birth to Jesus, and in doing so, began the Church. 

3. What is meant by the Assumption of Mary? 
    
Catholics believe that because of Mary’s unique role among all human beings, she was united with God at the end of her life on earth without going through the corruption of death. This is called the doctrine of the Assumption (because Mary was taken up, or “assumed” into heaven). 

4. At what different levels does the church exist? 
    
The Church can mean any of these a group of Christians gathered for worship, a specific parish or congregation, a local diocese, which is a group of many parishes or congregations led by a bishop, or the whole worldwide church. 

5. Describe the meaning of the images of the church as people of God, body of Christ, and temple of the Holy Spirit. 
    
These images show the Christian understanding of how the church is the work of the Trinity in human beings-the work of God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit. 

6. Why did Christianity become divided into different denominations? 
    
The splits in Christianity occurred for many reasons-sometimes the reasons were more senseless, having to do with political or military conflict, personal power struggles, or hurts and misunderstandings. Often a combination of all these reasons was involved. 

7. What is Catholic teaching about whether non-Christians can be saved? 
    
The Catholic answer to those questions is that God is certainly revealed in non-Christian religions. In fact, many of the moral concerns and principles of Christianity are shared by all the great religions of the world.
