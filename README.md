# Readme

These are all of my class notes, digitized and hosted on GitHub.
Direct answers to tests, quizzes and ongoing assignments will not be included here, and tests will be under no circumstances included, as per the Providence Catholic Academic Integrity Code
This repo is intended to help other who may be taking the same classes as I am right now in the future, as well as those currently in those classes.

By using these nots, you are agreeing not to use them to cheat, only to study or use as reference. In addition, I will not be liable for any cheating.

### Roadmap
- Add hosting with GitHub pages or a Wiki
- Keep notes up to date and accurate

### Changelog
8/22/25 - Created README.md, and updated some existing files
