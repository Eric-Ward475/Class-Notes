These are all of my class notes, digitized and hosted on GitHub.
Direct answers to tests, quizzes and ongoing assignments will not be included here, and tests will be under no circumstances included, as per the Providence Catholic Academic Integrity Code.
This repo is intended to help other who may be taking the same classes as I am right now in the future, as well as those currently in those classes.

By using these notes, you are agreeing not to use them to cheat, only to study or use as reference. In addition, I will not be liable for any cheating.

Any review questions that are graded will not be posted until after the due date.

### Setup
***There are 2 options for set up***

### Option 1 (Recommended)
It is recommended to use Obsidian to view the notes. There are links in many files, and helps to organize things a little better. 

- To install Obsidian, go to https://obsidian.md/download and follow their download instructions
- To add the repo, clone it to your desired directory
	- If you don't know what that means, follow:
		[this](https://github.com/Eric-Ward475/Class-Notes/blob/main/gen.%20info/cloning%20the%20repo.md)
	- (obsidian link: [[cloning the repo]])
- Open the folder as a vault in Obsidian
	- Click 'Open folder as vault' and select either the cloned repo's folder or where you extracted the .zip
- Done!
- If you used GH Desktop, make sure to update the locally stored files every time you use them, as they are updated almost every day, sometimes multiple times per day
- If you used any manual methods, be sure to redownload, if something you need is online but not on your computer

### Option 2 (Less tech required)
This is not recommended, because no links within the notes will work. You can still use them, but some benefits may be lost.

- Navigate through the folders within GitHub's website

##### ***NOTE: THIS IS UPDATED ALMOST DAILY, YOU NEED TO REFRESH THE CLONED REPO REGULARLY***

### Supporting/Contributing
- All contributors get a cut of any monetary proceeds, based on how much they contribute
- You can contribute by:
	- Reporting any issues with the notes (typos, error, etc) to me at any of my contacts that can be found on my GitHub home page, or through GitHub Issues
	- Helping add to the notes by sending in your personal notes, or even typing them in the same format as I do
		- I will add them to the repo, and credit you for your submission
			- You can also create a Pull Request on GitHub, if you are able to (preferred)
		- I ask that submissions are sent directly to me, to avoid conflict
		- All notes must be typed in valid markdown format, and AI may not be directly used, meaning that any submissions must be essentially hand typed, although using AI to summarize text IS allowed.
	- Suggesting features, topics or anything else to me directly
- You can support by:
	- Informing others of the repository
	- Small donations (I legitimately do not want your money, most of any proceeds would go directly to other contributors
- Content requests can be completed either by contacting me directly or by creating an Issue on GitHub

### Road-map
- Add hosting with GitHub pages or a Wiki
- Keep notes up to date and accurate
- Add notes for classes I am not in (Relies on other people sending notes to upload, or me independently taking the course)
