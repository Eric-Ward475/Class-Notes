These are all of my class notes, digitized and hosted on GitHub.
Direct answers to tests, quizzes and ongoing assignments will not be included here, and tests will be under no circumstances included, as per the Providence Catholic Academic Integrity Code
This repo is intended to help other who may be taking the same classes as I am right now in the future, as well as those currently in those classes.

By using these nots, you are agreeing not to use them to cheat, only to study or use as reference. In addition, I will not be liable for any cheating.

### Setup
***There are 2 options for set up***

#### Option 1 (Recommended)
It is recommended to use Obsidian to view the notes. There are links in many files, and helps to organize things a little better. 

- To install Obsidian, go to https://obsidian.md/download and follow their download instructions
- To add the repo, clone it to your desired directory
	- If you don't know what that means, follow:
