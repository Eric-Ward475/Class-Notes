### Perseus

**Background**
- Son of Zeus and Danae

**Quest**
- The ruler of Seriphos (Polydectes) wanted to be with Danae
- Perseus did not want this to happen, so in order to get rid of him, Polydectes demanded what seemed to be an impossible gift (The head of a Gorgon)
- Perseus had help from divinities:
	- Hermes gave him a mythical sword, not breakable by Medusa's scales
	- Athena gave him a bronze shield, allowing him not to look directly at Medusa
	- The gods directed him to the Graiae
		- They were 3 women who shared one eye
		- Perseus seized their eye and forced them to tell the way to the nymphs of the North
	- The nymphs gave him
		- Winged sandals
		- A wallet that could hold anything
		- A cap of invisibility
- Perseus reached the Gorgons, and looking only through the reflection in his bronze shield, cut off Medusa's head and put it in the wallet

**Return and Post-Quest**
- On his was back home, he rescued Andromeda
- When he returned, he found Polydectes threatening Danae
	- He revealed Medusa's head, turning Polydectes and his supporters to stone
- Perseus gave the head to Athena, who placed it on her sheild (called the aegis)

### Theseus

**Background**
- Theseus was son of Aegeus (King of Athens and Aethra)
- Grew up in Troezen
- Aegeus left a sword and sandals under a great stone, for when Theseus was strong enough to claim them
- Once he could lift the stone, Theseus journeyed to Athens, using the land route rather than the safer sea route

**Quest**
- On his way, he killed many bandits
	- Periphetes (club bearer)
	- Sinis (Pine bearer)
	- Sciron (Forced travelers to wash his feet and then kicked them in to the sea)
	- Procrustes
- While in Athens, Medea feared Theseus and tried to poison him
- Theseus killed the Minotaur with the help of Minos' daughter Ariadne
