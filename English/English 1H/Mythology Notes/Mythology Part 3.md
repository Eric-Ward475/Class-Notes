### Perseus

**Background**
- Son of Zeus and Danae

**Quest**
- The ruler of Seriphos (Polydectes) wanted to be with Danae
- Perseus did not want this to happen, so in order to get rid of him, Polydectes demanded what seemed to be an impossible gift (The head of a Gorgon)
- Perseus had help from divinities:
	- Hermes gave him a mythical sword, not breakable by Medusa's scales
	- Athena gave him a bronze shield, allowing him not to look directly at Medusa
	- The gods directed him to the Graiae
		- They were 3 women who shared one eye
		- Perseus seized their eye and forced them to tell the way to the nymphs of the North
	- The nymphs gave him
		- Winged sandals
		- A wallet that could hold anything
		- A cap of invisibility
- Perseus reached the Gorgons, and looking only through the reflection in his bronze shield, cut off Medusa's head and put it in the wallet

**Return and Post-Quest**
- On his was back home, he rescued Andromeda
- When he returned, he found Polydectes threatening Danae
	- He revealed Medusa's head, turning Polydectes and his supporters to stone
- Perseus gave the hear to Athena

### Theseus

**Background**
- Son of Aegeus, King of Athens and Aethra
- Grew up in Troezen
- His father left a sword and sandals hidden under a large stone, to be claimed when Theseus was strong enough
- When Theseus was able to lift the stone, he journeyed to Athens, choosing to travel by land
	- This caused him to face unnecessary dangers
	- A sea route would have been safer

**Journey to Athens**
- On the journey, he killed many bandits, including
	- Periphetes (the club-bearer)
	- Sinis (the bine-bender)
	- Sciron (forced travelers to wash his feet, then kicked them into the sea)
	- Procrustes (stretched of cut down travelers to fit his iron bed)
