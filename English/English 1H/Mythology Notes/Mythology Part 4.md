### Pre Trojan War

**The Judgement of Paris**
- The root cause of the war traces back to Eris, who was upset because she was not invited to a banquet on Olympus
- She threw a golden apple marked with 'For the Fairest'
- Three goddesses wanted to claim it (Hera, Athena and Aphrodite)
- They asked Zeus to judge which of them was the fairest, but refused (trying to avoid Hera's wrath), and send them to Paris, a Trojan prince
- Each goddess offered something to Paris as a bride
	- Hera offered power over all of Asia
	- Athena offered victory in wars
	- Aphrodite offered the most beautiful woman in the world
- Paris chose Aphrodite's offer, claiming Helen of Sparta (most beautiful woman)

**The Abduction of Helen**
- Helen was already married to Menelaus, the king of Sparta
- Aphrodite took Paris to Sparta, where he was first welcomed, before abducting Helen (while Menelaus was away)
- All the Greek chieftains had sworn an oath to defend the marriage of Helen, so they united to bring her back to Menelaus

**The Gathering of the Greek Army**
- The Greek Army was lead by Agamemnon (the king of Mycenae, and Menelaus' brother)
- Many important Greek heroes joined in the fight, including Odysseus and Achilles

**Sacrifice of Iphigenia**
- The Greek army assembled at Aulis, but the winds prevented their ships from sailing
- The prophet Calchas declared that Artemis was angry and demanded a sacrifice
- Agamemnon was forced to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia
- After this, the winds allowed the ships to sail to Troy

### The Trojan War

**Beginning of the War**
- The Greek army laid seige to Troy, but was unable to take the city easily
- The war lasted for 9 years, with neither side gaining a decisive advantage
- Chryseis (daughter of Apollo's preist) was taken as a war prize by Agamemnon
	- In anger, Apollo sent plagues on the Greeks unti Chryseis was returned
	- Afterwards, Agamemnon took Briseis (AchIlles' war prize, this caused Achilles to withdraw from battle)

**Gods' Involvement**
- Some gods took sides in the war
	- Hera, Athena and Poseidon sided with the Greeks
	- Aphrodite, Ares, Apollo and Artemis sided with the Trojans

**Death of Patroclus and the Return of Achilles**
- The Trojans, under the leadership of Hector, began the push the Greek lines back
- Achilles still refused to fight, so his friend, Partoclus put on Achilles' armor and the the Mymidons
- Hector killed Patroclus, thinking he had killed Achilles
- Grief stricken, Achilles returned to battle
	- His mother, Thetis brought him a new set of armor from Hephaestus
	- Achilles killed Hector and mockingly dragged his body around the walls of Troy
	- King Priam (Hector's father) pleaded with Achilles to return the body of Hector
	- Moved with grief, Achilles returned the body for proper burial

**Death of Achilles**
- Paris, with the help of Apollo shot an arrow that struck Achilles' heel, his only vulnerable spot
	- Thetis had dipped him in the River Styx as an infant, but held him by the heel
	- This granted him invulnerability
- The Greeks buried him, and his armor was given to Odysseus
	- Since his armor was from Hephaestus, it was to be given to the bravest Greek
	- It came down to Ajax and Odysseus, with Odysseus being selected in the end by the Greek leaders
	- Ajax, in humiliation went insane (literally)
		- In madness, he slaughtered cattle, thinking they were his enemies
		- When he came to his senses, he killed himself

**The Fall of Troy**
- The Greeks realized that they could not win the war decisively with force, so Odysseus devised the Trojan Horse
	- It was prophesied that Troy could not fall unless:
		- The Greeks retrieved Hercules' bow and arrows (possessed by Piloctetes)
		- A Trojan, Helenus was captured (a prophet, the son of Priam)
		- The Greeks too that Palladium (sacred image of Athena) from within Troy
	- Odysseus carried out these tasks
- The Trojan Horse was a large wooden horse, hollowed on the inside, so that Greek warriors could fit inside
- The Horse was meant as a surrender prize, it was left outside the gates of Troy, while the rest of the Greek army pretended to sail away
	- In reality, the army sailed to a nearby island, Tenedos, to wait for the plan to succeed
	- The Greeks left a single man behind to trick the Trojans, Sinon
- Sinon told the Trojans that he was left behind by the Greeks, claiming the horse was an offer to Athena, meant to ensure safe return
- He also explained that the horse was build very large so the Trojans could not bring it inside the city
- The Trojans brought the horse inside, despite warnings from Laocoon and Cassandra
- During the night, the Greeks exited the horse, opened the gates and let the rest of the army in
- Troy fell, all of it men were killed, and its women and children were enslaved
- Almost no one escaped

**Fate of Helen**
- Menelaus confronted Helen, intending to kill her at first
- Her beauty changed his mind, causing him to instead take her back to Sparta

**In the End**
- Troy was completely destroyed
- Almost all men were killed, with only few such as Aeneas escaping
- Most women and children were enslaved
- The war ended not in glory, but in ruin, treachery, and tragedy
