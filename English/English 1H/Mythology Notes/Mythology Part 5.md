### The House of Atreus

**Cadmus and the Founding of Thebes**
- Cadmus was the brother of Europa, the maiden abducted by Zeus, in the form of a bull
- Cadmus's father (Agenor) sent him out to search for Europa, not to return until he found her
- Cadmus failed to find Europa, but before returning to home, he went to Delphi to ask Apollo for advice
	- He was told to follow a cow until it laid down, and there he should build a city
- Cadmus obeyed, following the cow to Boeotia, founding Thebes there
- Some of the men under his command were killed by a dragon that was sacred to Ares
	- Cadmus killed the dragon, and planted the dragon's teeth as if they were seeds
	- From the ground sprang warriors who fought eachother until only 5 remained
		- Those men became the first citizens of Thebes
	- To make amends for killing the dragon, Cadmus served Ares for 8 years
		- To reward Cadmus, Ares gave him his daughter (Harmonia) in marriage
		- All the gods came to their wedding, bringing incredible gifts, including a necklace from Hephaestus that gave bad luck to the owner
		- Cadmus and Harmonia had several children, but tragedy haunted their family
			- They left Thebes, journeying to Illyria, where they were turned to serpents by the gods
