- Later poets told its entrance as a cavern or near deep lakes
- The 2 most major divisions were Tartarus and Erebus, with the first being the worst of the 2
- Erebus was where the dead first passed after death
- In Homer's poems, it is vague. 'A shadowy place inhabited by shadows'
- Later poets describe it as a place where the good are rewarded and the wicked punished
- Virgil is the only poet who gives clear geography of the Underworld
- According to Mythology by Edith Hamilton: The path down to it leads to where Acheron, the river of woe, pours into Cocytus, the river of lamentation. An aged boatman named Charon ferries the souls of the dead across the water to the farther bank, where stands the adamantine gate to Tartarus (the name Virgil prefers). Charon will receive into his boat only the souls of those upon whose lips the passage money was placed when they died and who were duly buried. On guard before the gate sits CERBERUS, the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog, who permits all spirits to enter, but none to return. On his arrival each one is brought before three judges, Rhadamanthus, Minos, and Aeacus, who pass sentence and send the wicked to everlasting torment and the good to a place of blessedness called the Elysian Fields. Three other rivers, besides Acheron and Cocytus, separate the underworld from the world above: Phlegethon, the river of fire; Styx, the river of the unbreakable oath by which the gods swear; and Lethe, the river of forgetfulness. Somewhere in this vast region is Plutoâ€™s palace, but beyond saying that it is many-gated and crowded with innumerable guests, no writer describes it. Around it are wide wastes, wan and cold, and meadows of asphodel, presumably strange, pallid, ghostly flowers. We do not know anything more about it. The poets did not care to linger in that gloom-hidden abode.
- The Furies are placed by Virgil here, where they punish the evil
