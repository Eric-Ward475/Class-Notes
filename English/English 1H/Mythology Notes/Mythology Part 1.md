For through a man has sorrow and grief in his soul, yet when the servant of the Muses sings, at once he forgets his dark thoughts and remembers not his troubles. Such is the holy gift of the Muses to men."

### The Underworld
- The Underworld was also known as 'The Kindgdom of the Dead'
- Ruled over by Hades and his queen, Persephone
- The Underworld is also sometimes simply called 'Hades'
- According to the Iliad, it lies beneath the Earth
- In the Odyssey, it is past the edge of the world, across Ocean (the world-encircling river)
- Later poets told its entrance as a cavern or near deep lakes
- The 2 most major divisions were Tartarus and Erebus, with the first being the worst of the 2
- Erebus was where the dead first passed after death
- In Homer's poems, it is vague. 'A shadowy place inhabited by shadows'
- Later poets describe it as a place where the good are rewarded and the wicked punished
- Virgil is the only poet who gives clear geography of the Underworld
- According to Mythology by Edith Hamilton: The path down to it leads to where Acheron, the river of woe, pours into Cocytus, the river of lamentation. An aged boatman named Charon ferries the souls of the dead across the water to the farther bank, where stands the adamantine gate to Tartarus (the name Virgil prefers). Charon will receive into his boat only the souls of those upon whose lips the passage money was placed when they died and who were duly buried. On guard before the gate sits CERBERUS, the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog, who permits all spirits to enter, but none to return. On his arrival each one is brought before three judges, Rhadamanthus, Minos, and Aeacus, who pass sentence and send the wicked to everlasting torment and the good to a place of blessedness called the Elysian Fields. Three other rivers, besides Acheron and Cocytus, separate the underworld from the world above: Phlegethon, the river of fire; Styx, the river of the unbreakable oath by which the gods swear; and Lethe, the river of forgetfulness. Somewhere in this vast region is Pluto’s palace, but beyond saying that it is many-gated and crowded with innumerable guests, no writer describes it. Around it are wide wastes, wan and cold, and meadows of asphodel, presumably strange, pallid, ghostly flowers. We do not know anything more about it. The poets did not care to linger in that gloom-hidden abode.
- The Furies are placed by Virgil here, where they punish the evil
- They were usually said to be 3 in number, Tisiphone, Megaera and Alecto

### The 2 Great Gods of Earth
- They were Demeter and Dionysus
	- Demeter was goddess of farming and agriculture
	- Dionysus was god of the vine, sometimes considered an Olympian, depending on the writer
	- They experienced great sadness when the frost came to Earth and wiped out the vines and crops after the harvest

**Demeter**
- Goddess of Corn, the Harvest and Crops
- Demeter is known to be older because farm fields (specifically corn) came much before vine farming was a thing
	- Demeter is a goddess because farming crops was not seen as the duty of men, the women typically tended the crops
- The Greeks believed that at any moment Demeter could be present at any farm field, as they were her temples
- Rather than bloody sacrifices (that men tended to enjoy) , Demeter was worshiped by the careful tending to crops
- Her chief festival was during the harvest
	- In early days, it was probably a simple festival in which farmers gave thanks for their harvest, and reverently broke bread made with the freshly harvested wheat
	- In later times, the festival grew to be a much more major event, but little is known about it
	- What was known as the great festival occurred in September, but only every 5 years, and lasted 9 days
		- It was a time of processions, sacrifices and utmost reverence
		- Most everyday tasks were suspended in honor of it
		- The main part of this festival was a ceremony held in the great temple of Demeter, in a town called Eleusis
			- Little is known about it because all people involved in it were bound to secrecy regarding what went on inside; only stray bits of information are known
			- The event was called the 'Eleusinian Mysteries'
			- The event was held in great reverence in both Roman and Greek traditions

**Dionysus**
- God of wine and vines
- No one knows clearly when or how Dionysus came to join Demeter at the temple of Eleusis
- He was considered very close to Demeter in importance
- He was worshiped alongside Demeter
- The harvest was also Dionysus' festival, specifically when the grapes from the harvest were brought to the grape press to be made into wine

### The Story of Demeter
- Demeter had a single daughter, Persephone;
	- Maiden of the maiden of the Spring
	- Goddess of spring and nature
	- Wife of Hades, therefore the Queen of the Underworld
**Abduction of Persephone**
- Demeter had lost Persephone, and in grief withheld her gifts from the earth, causing the Ice age
- Persephone had been abducted by Hades to the underworld, and her mother heard her cries
	- Demeter tried to follow Hades and reclaim her daughter, but could not because no one told her the truth about where Persephone was
	- Demeter wandered for 9 days, looking for Persephone
	- Eventually, the Sun told her what had happened
	- Demeter sunk to an even lower depression, and left Olympus, living on Earth among mortals
**Demeter's Life on Earth**
- She disguised herself so no mortals could distinguish her as a goddess
- While on Earth, she came to Eleusis and was at a well when 4 maidens approached her
	- They brought Demeter into their home
	- The maidens' mother (Metaneira) offered Demeter wine, but Demeter turned down the offer, asking instead for barley-water flavored with mint, which was commonly a farmer's drink
	- The mother had a son, Demophoön, who she bore to Celeus
		- Demeter was allowed to nurse this young boy, who grew like a young god
		- Every day, Demeter gave him ambrosia (The food/drink of gods, that grants immortality) and placed him in the fire to 'burn away his mortal nature'
		- One day, the mother saw Demeter placing the child in the fire
			- Thinking that Demeter was trying to burn the child alive, she screamed and in doing so, broke the ritual that Demeter was performing
			- This caused Demeter to get upset, because she was actually trying to give the child eternal youth and freedom from death

**Dionysus**
- Dionysus was the only god whose parents were not both gods
	- His mother was a woman named Semele, a Theban princess
	- His father was Zeus
	- Zeus swore on the river Styx that he would do anything that she asked of him
		- Swearing something on the Styx was an unbreakable vow that not even Zeus could break
		- Semele asked to see Zeus in his full glory as King of Heaven and Lord of the Thunderbolt
		- No mortal can see any god in their true godly form and live, but Zeus had no choice but to reveal himself to her, as he had taken a vow
		- This wish was put in Semele's heart by Hera, who was Jealous as always
- When he was grown, he wandered to many strange places
	- Everywhere he went, he taught men about the vine
	- Everyone accepted him as a god, until he came near to his own country
		- One day, he was abducted by pirates hoping to kidnap him for a ransom
			- He looked like the son of royalty, and the pirates thought that his parents would pay much for his safety
			- They were unable to bind him, the ropes that they tried to use fell apart when they touched his hands or feet
			- A single helmsman understood what was happening and announced that this man must be a god and should be set free at once or they would all be punished
				- The captain mocked him for this
			- The ship would not move when the pirates tried to sail away
			- The ship was overtaken by the power of Dionysus, with vines taking over and wine running down the decks
			- Dionysus turned all the men to dolphins as they tried to flee overboard, but had mercy on the man who acknowledged him as a god
- Dionysus could be kind and merciful to men, but was also cruel sometimes
- Dionysus was sad because he had never met his mother, so he went to the underworld to retake her from Death
	- Death yielded, and the god brought her to Olympus, where she was accepted by the other gods
	- Even though she was a mortal, she was still accepted to Olympus, as she was the mother of a god
- Dionysus' intermittent temperament makes sense because wine not only makes men happier, it also makes them violent and drunk
- His saddest time was also during the winter, where all vines were frozen over and made to look like they would never bear fruit or leaves again

### How the World and Mankind Were Created
**Pre Earth**
- Before the creation of Earth and the gods, the story was very vague
- Earth and Heaven were given a personality of sorts, but were not recognized as alive
- Earth was simply created, the Greeks never tried to explain how or why, simply that it just happened

**Early Earth**
- The first creatures that resembled life were the children of Mother Earth and Father Heaven (or Gaea and Ouranos)
- Those creatures were monster, similar to how we believe that the Earth was inhabited by dinosaurs, the Greeks though of beasts like them too
- The Greeks imagined them as somewhat like men, but still not human
- They were very strong
- In most stories, they do not seem alive, rather as unstoppable forces that shaped the Earth
- Mother Earth and Father Heaven produced the Titans
- Cronus attacked Ouranos, doing a lot of damage, and from his blood, the Giants (4th race of monsters) sprang from his blood, alongside the Furies
- The Furies pursue and punish sinners
- Cronus was lord of the universe, with his sister-queen, Rhea
- The time period of Cronus' rule was called the Golden Age

**The Overthrowing of Cronus and the Rise of Zeus**
- After an unknown amount of time, Zeus (Son of Cronus and Rhea) rebelled against Cronus
- Zeus had a good reason to do so, when Cronus had learned that one of his children would overthrow him one day, he swallowed each of them right at their birth
- Rhea was not happy with her children being eaten, so after Zeus' birth, she had him secretly carried off to Crete, where he lived until adulthood
- Instead of giving Cronus Zeus to swallow, Rhea gave him a large stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, tricking Cronus
- When Zeus was grown, he forced Cronus (with the help of the Earth, his grandmother) to disgorge (vomit) the rest of the children who had been swallowed by Cronus
- After this, there was a terrible was between the Titans, lead by Cronus, against Zeus, with the help of his 5 brothers and sisters
- This war almost destroyed the universe
- The Titans were defeated by Zeus, partly because Zeus had released the monsters that had formed the Earth (book calls them hundred headed monsters)
- One Titan, Prometheus, was known for being very wise and took sides with Zeus
- After the war, Zeus punished his enemies brutally
- The Titan Atlas was punished worse than any Titan, he was forced to bear the entire weight of the world on his shoulders

**Post War**
- Even after the war was over, and the Titans punished, Zeus was not completely victorious
- Earth gave birth to her last and worst offspring, Typhon
- Zeus had thunder and lightning solely under his control
- He used them to strike down Typhon
- After Typhon, there was one more attempt made to unseat Zeus: the Giants' rebellion
- At this time, the rest of the gods were very strong and they assisted Zeus alongside Hercules (a son of Zeus)
- The giants were defeated and sent down to Tartarus
- From then on, the gods ruled as undisputed lords of all creation

**Creation of mankind**
- The earth was believed to be a round disk, divided into two equal parts by the Mediterranean
- Around the disk-earth, is the great river, Ocean
	- Crossing over Ocean, to the far banks were mysterious people who few people ever saw
	- The Cimmerians lived that
	- On Ocean's bank was the abode of the blessed dead
		- There is no snowfall here or winter at all
		- It is a perfect land
- There are multiple stories for the appearance of mankind
	- According to one story, the gods delegated the creation of man to Prometheus, known for his wisdom (even wiser than the gods)
		- Prometheus' brother, Epimetheus was originally in charge or the creation of man, but was too impulsive and gave all the good qualities to animals, rather than men
		- Prometheus took over creation, after his brother asked him for help
		- He made men upright animals, gave them intelligence and brought them a lit torch from heaven, giving them fire; a protection far better than anything else
	- In another story, the gods themselves created men
		- Each race was named after a metal that they were crafted in an experiment from
		- They first made a golden race, mortal but lived like gods with no pain, toil or sadness
		- Next, the gods made silver, an inferior race with little intelligence. They could not keep from injuring each other, and their spirits did not live on after they died
		- The next were brass, they were very strong, but very violent. They destroyed themselves in wars
		- They were followed by a race of godlike heroes who fought glorious wars and went on great adventures, after their passing, they went to the isles of the blessed, where they lived in perfect bliss forever
		- The final race is the one that still exists on earth: the iron race
		- They live in evil times, and their nature is of evil, never resting from toil and sorrow
		- The children are always inferior to their fathers
- During the Golden Age, only men were on the earth; there were no women
- Zeus created women later in anger at Prometheus for caring so much for men
	- Women were meant to be a punishment for mankind; a great evil
	- The first woman was Pandora, created by Zeus as an embodiment of evil towards men
	- She was described as 'a sweet and lovely thing to look upon, in the likeness of a shy maiden'
	- All the gods gave her gifts
	- Pandora means "the gift of all"
	- From Pandora comes the race of women, who are an evil to men, with a nature to do evil
- Another story of the creation of Pandora;
	- Zeus created a woman, a person designed to be a problem, and give her a box containing something harmful from each of the gods, and forbade her to ever open it
	- Zeus sent her to Epimetheus, who was glad for a new type of man
	- Prometheus had warned his brother not to take anything from Zeus, but he did anyways
	- Epimetheus took Pandora, and 'afterward when that dangerous thing, a woman, was his, he understood how good his brother's advice had been'
	- Pandora, like all women had a very strong sense of curiosity
	- She decided that she had to know what was in the box, and one day, opened the lid
		- From the lid, plagues, sorrow and mischief emerged, never to leave mankind
		- One single good thing was left inside, Hope
		- It is mankind's sole comfort in misfortune

**The Great Flood**
- At one point, Zeus saw that mankind was becoming too wicked for the world
- He called for the help for his brother, Poseidon, to flood to earth
- Together, Zeus and Poseidon flooded the earth, wiping out all of mankind
- Prometheus knew that the flood was coming, so he protected Deucalion and Pyrrha, he was Prometheus' son and she was the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora
- Prometheus told his son to build a large chest, store provisions and go into it with his wife
- They survived the flood and were the only survivors
- Zeus was not angered because of this because both survivors were pious, and faithful worshipers of the gods
