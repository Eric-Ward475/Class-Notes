### The Quest of the Golden Fleece

- Jason was the first great European hero, living a generation before Odysseus
- The quest was a sea adventure, unlike later quests which were mostly by land

**Background**
- King Athamas abandoned his first wife, Nephele, for Ino, who plotted against Nephele’s children
- Ino parched the seed-corn before planting, causing famine, and bribed the oracle to demand the boy, Phrixus, be sacrificed
- As he was about to be killed, a golden ram (sent by Hermes) carried Phrixus and his sister Helle away
- Helle fell into the sea (the Hellespont, “Helle’s sea”) and died
- Phrixus reached Colchis, where he sacrificed the ram to Zeus and gave its fleece to King Aeëtes
- Phrixus’ cousin, Pelias, seized the throne of Iolcus in Greece, driving out Jason’s father

**Jason and Pelias**
- Jason returned to claim the throne
- Pelias agreed to give it up if Jason brought back the Golden Fleece from Colchis

**The Argonauts**
- Jason gathered a crew of heroes: Hercules, Orpheus, Castor and Pollux, Peleus (Achilles’ father), Atalanta (in some accounts), and others
- They sailed on the ship _Argo_

**Adventures on the Voyage**
- **Lemnos**: island where women (having killed all the men) welcomed the Argonauts
- **Harpies**: bird-women who plagued the blind prophet Phineus by fouling his food; the Boreads (sons of the North Wind) drove them off
- **Symplegades (Clashing Rocks)**: smashed ships; the Argonauts tested with a dove, and after it passed through safely, they rowed through and the rocks ceased moving forever

**Arrival in Colchis**
- King Aeëtes demanded Jason perform impossible tasks to earn the fleece:
    - Yoke two fire-breathing bulls
    - Plow a field and sow it with dragon’s teeth (which sprouted into armed warriors)
- Medea, Aeëtes’ daughter (a sorceress, struck by love for Jason by Hera and Aphrodite’s plan), helped him:
    - Gave him ointment to protect against fire and steel
    - Warned him to throw a stone among the dragon-teeth men, making them fight each other instead of him

**The Theft of the Fleece**
- Medea lulled the serpent guarding the fleece to sleep with her magic, allowing Jason to seize it
- She fled with Jason, killing her brother Apsyrtus (in some versions scattering his body so Aeëtes had to stop and gather the pieces)

**Return Journey**
- Medea’s magic saved them again:
    - On the way home, the Argonauts stopped in Phaeacia, where Medea was sheltered from her father        
    - Later, Medea killed Pelias by tricking his daughters: she cut up an old ram, boiled it, and produced a young lamb; the daughters tried the same with Pelias, but he did not return to life

**Jason and Medea**
- Jason abandoned Medea for the princess of Corinth
- Medea’s revenge:
    - Sent the bride a robe anointed with deadly poison, which burned her to death
    - Killed her own children with Jason
    - Escaped in a dragon-drawn chariot, leaving Jason to live in misery
