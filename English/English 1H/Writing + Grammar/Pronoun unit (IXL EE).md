### Pronoun antecedents

- Antecedent means receiver
- The antecedent of the pronoun is the noun that the pronoun refers to

**Rules**
- The pronoun must always agree with the antecedent (if the antecedent is plural, so is the pronoun)
- Compound nouns can change agreement
	- Jeff **AND** Joe
- Indefinite pronouns are always considered singular
	- Indefinite pronouns are pronouns that do not refer to anything in particular
	- Anything, someone, something, etc
- Companies, organizations and schools are singular
- Pronouns should not be ambiguous (Only have one clear antecedent)
- The antecedent should be a singular word, not a phrase or idea
- Avoid unclear uses of 'this', 'that', or 'they'

### Relative pronouns

- Relative pronouns link independent and dependent clauses
- Examples of relative pronouns:
	- Who
		- Used for people
		- Used when referring to the subject of a sentence
	- Whom
		- Used for people
		- Used when referring to the object of a sentence
	- Whose
		- Used to show possession
	- That
		- Used for people, animals or things
		- Can also be a subject or an object
		- Used in restrictive (needed in the sentence) clauses

**Who vs Whom**
- Who is used for the subject of a sentence or clause
- Whom is used for the direct object of a sentence or clause
- Examples (Who):
	- Who was the man who helped me at the Library?
	- Stephen Hawking was a scientist who did not have a religious affiliation.
- Examples (Whom):
	- I love people whom are sociable and friendly.
	- I have studied those whom played a significant role in American history.

### Vague pronouns

- Vague pronouns are pronouns that can have multiple antecedents in a sentence or clause
- Examples:
	- Joe asked Jeff if *he* had an extra pen for *him*
	- The republican politician is always debating the democratic politician, although *they* never seem to win the debates.
