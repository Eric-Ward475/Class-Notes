- Antecedent means receiver
- The antecedent of the pronoun is the noun that the pronoun refers to

**Rules**
- The pronoun must always agree with the antecedent (if the antecedent is plural, so is the pronoun)
- Compound nouns can change agreement
	- Jeff **AND** Joe
- Indefinite pronouns are always considered singular
	- Indefinite pronouns are pronouns that do not refer to anything in particular
	- Anything, someone, something, etc
- Companies, organizations and schools are singular
- Pronouns should not be ambiguous (Only have one clear antecedent)
- The antecedent should be a singular word, not a phrase or idea
- Avoid unclear uses of 'this', 'that', or 'they'
