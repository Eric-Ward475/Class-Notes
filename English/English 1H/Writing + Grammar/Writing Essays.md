	- Body paragraphs
		- Topic Sentence
		- Chunk
		- CD
		- CM

	- Conclusion paragraph

**Structure of the Introduction**
- Starts with a theme from the story
	- Often, longer stories have multiple themes
	- The theme is a universal concept, not necessarily directly tied to the story
	- The theme tells a central idea of the text, without making any plot references
- Sentence 2 expands on the opening sentence, giving thoughts about it
	- All CM
- Sentence 3 further expands on the theme, maybe connecting to the literature, but not making direct plot references
- Sentence 4 leads into the thesis
- Sentence 5 is the thesis
	- Begins with 'In.. (Text name), by (Author name)'
	- Only part of the introduction with a direct link to the literature being analyzed
- The introduction is almost always at least 5 sentences
- Should be written last, after body paragraphs
	- To accurately and elegantly blend your introduction together, all parts must be somewhat related to the rest of the essay
	- However, the thesis is still needed to write the body paragraphs and conclusion

**Body Paragraphs**
- Composed of chunks:
	- Topic sentence
	- Concrete detail
	- Commentary(s)
- Each of these are discussed above

**Concluding paragraph**
- Has 4 requirements
	- First sentence restates the these, but in totally different words
	- All commentary (no CD)
	- Does not repeat key words from anywhere in the essay
	- Must give a finished feeling to the essay
- Sums up the essay; a wrap up

### Writing Chunks

**Chunk**
- A unified group of sentences or thoughts
- Combines CDs and CMs

**How to write**
- There are 3 parts to a chunk (some people teach 4)
	1. Topic Sentence (TS):
		- A clear sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph
		- Should connect to your thesis and set the tone for the chunk (Called mini-thesis, sometimes)
		- Example: "The third pig in 'The Three Little Pigs' demonstrates wisdom through his careful planning."
	2. Concrete Detail (CD):
		- A specific piece of evidence or fact to support your topic sentence
		- This could be a quote, statistic, or example
		- This contains no commentary (Opinion)
		- Example: "For instance, he builds his house out of sturdy bricks, unlike his brothers who use straw and sticks."
	3. Commentary (CM):
		- Explain why the evidence is significant
		- Offer your interpretation or analysis to show how it supports your argument
		- Example: "This shows that the third pig values security and foresight, which ultimately saves him from the wolf's attack."
	4. Concluding Sentence (CS):
		- The 'wrap up' of the chunk
		- Finishes the paragraph elegantly, ensuring that the reader understands the purpose of the paragraph clearly
		- Sometimes, this is simply considered a second piece of CM, but it ultimately does the same thing
		- Example: "Thus, the third pig's wisdom highlights the importance of preparation and careful decision-making."
