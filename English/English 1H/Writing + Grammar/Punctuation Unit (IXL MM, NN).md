###### Commas
- 

###### Semicolons
- When you have 2 related independent clauses, a semicolon can be used to combine them
- Do not overuse the semicolon
- Used with conjunctive adverbs (however wherever, therefore, nevertheless, etc)
	- After the adverb, place a comma
- Use semicolons to break up large lists, especially where commas are used in the list itself
	- Eg in dates (March 11th, 2023; November 12th, 2003;...)

###### Colons
- For lists smaller than semi colon use cases, use a colon and then list the elements, separated by commas
	- "My favorite colors are: red, green, blue and brown"
