### Bubble Clusters
1. The subject of the pre-write goes in a circle located in the middle of a graph
2. Each idea is numbered. The center bubble (main idea) is #1
3. Branching off from the main idea are #2 bubbles, or supporting details (SDs)
4. Branching off from the #2 bubbles are #3 bubbles, or concrete details (CDs)
5. Each #2 should have at least 2-3 CDs
6. Each CD should have at least 5 words inside (not including "and", "but", or "or")

### Spider Diagrams
1. The subject of the pre-write goes in a box located in the middle of a graph
2. Similar to Bubble Clusters, except that Spider diagrams use only straight lines to connect ideas and other than the title, nothing is boxed or circled, rather all SDs and CDs are underlined

### Outlines
1. The title is the subject of the pre-write
2. This format uses organized indentation and formatting to separate ideas
3. The lines starting with Roman numerals (I, II, and III) are the same as #2 ideas
4. Indented further are capital letters, representing #3 details
Example:

English Class
I. Reading
	A. 
	B. 
	C. 
II. Writing
	A. 
	B. 
	C. 
III. Grammar
	A. 
	B. 
	C. 

### Line Clusters
1. The subject of the pre-write is written at the top
2. Then 3 steps are followed:
	1. Step 1: List
		1. List CDs in any order
		2. You need at least 6
	2. Step 2: Categorize
		1. Categorize your ideas
		2. You need at least 2 categories
	3. Label
		1. Label all ideas with each category
